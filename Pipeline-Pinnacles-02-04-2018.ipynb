    "<B>Figure 1</B> (Plot panel radiances...) will show overlay plots of panel radiances on both the left- and right-hand-sides, with the middle pane empty. All panel radiances should appear close together. If you notice a small number of panels that look significantly different, then these are probably bad panel radiances. You should try to identify the corresponding spectra and then add them to the 'bad_pans' list in Cell [2]. Once you have flagged the bad panel spectra, you should be able to re-run the notebook and this Figure will now show you the good and bad panels separated into the left and middle panes, respectively, with all panels together shown in the right pane.<BR><BR>\n",

    "    \n",
    "<B>Figure 3</B> (Plot ground spectra...) shows two panes, which initially will be the same, showing an overlay of all the ground radiances (without panels). This plot can be used to identify any outlying ground radiances, which can be subsequently identified using 'bad_grounds' in Cell [2]. Once such bad radiances have been flagged, then the two panes will show a with/without comparison.<BR><BR>\n",

    "<B>Figures 4 and 5</B> (Plot timelines...) will initially be the same. They show a line-by-line plot of the timelines of spectra taken, with the horizontal axis being seconds since the first spectrum was taken. Panel radiances are shown as blue crosses and ground radiances are shown as orange vertical lines. If there are any errant panel or graound radiances, based on the time they were taken, they can be identified here. Also, these plots can be used to assess when the panel readings for each line occur. If there are any bad panels or ground radiances, then they will be removed from the second figure.<BR><BR>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<B>Figure 6</B> (Create timeline...) Shows two panes with averaged radiances for panel spectra, as a function of time (in seconds, since the first spectrum). Initially they will show the same. The average panel readings should show a slowly changing curve that follows insolation. For example, field data taken in the morning will show a slowly rising curve, as the Sun rises. Deviatinos from this slowly changing curve may identify bad panel readings that should be flagged out in 'bad_pans' in Cell [2]. Once the notebook is re-run, any bad panels will be removed from the second pane.<BR><BR>\n",

Coloured curves show the average for all spectra in a Line. the right pane just shows a zoomed y-axis, compared to the left pane. Any unusually different spectra can be identified here and may be flagged in 'bad_grounds' in Cell [2].<BR><BR>\n",

    "<B>Figure 10</B> (Plot satellite band...) show the median ground reflectance, together with the wavelength ranges for the satellite corresponding to the data. This is just to check that the satellite bands fall within well-behaved parts of the spectrum.<BR><BR>\n",

    "<B>Figures 12, 13 and 14</B> show RGB images of the Satellite and field data, where the field data have been averaged into pixels that match the satellite data. Blank field pixels means that there is no field data corresponding to that pixel.<BR><BR>\n",
    "\n",
    "<B>Figure 15</B> (Variance) shows the band-by-band satellite data, together with representative variance values in the title. Variance is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation, divided by the mean for each band. This gives an indication of how much variability there is in the field site. There should typically be less than 5% variance.<BR><BR>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<B>Figure 16</B> (Plot ratio arrays) shows band-by-band images of the ratio between satellite and field arrays. All images have been scales to ratios between 0.9 and 1.1, such that green colours indicate a close match between field and satellite pixels.<BR><BR>\n",

    "<B>Figure 17</B> (Plot comparison spectra...) shows a band-by-band comparison of satellite and field data. Three spectra are shown. Black is the average spectrum for <I>all</I> satellite pixels, orange is the average for only those satellite pixels that overlap with at least one field spectrum. The blue spectrum shows the average for all field data. Any difference between the orange and black spectra is indicative of the variation in the ground spectrum, as measured by the satellite at slightly varying positions, so it gives a guide for how reliable the satellite data is.<BR><BR>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<B>Figure 18</B> (Comparison plot of...) shows a scatter plot, comparing the satellite and field data where there is at least one field spectrum overlapping with each satellite pixel. Different bands are shown with different symbols and colours.<BR><BR>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<B>Figure 19</B> shows the same as Figure 17, but for each band all the pixel data is averaged, so there is one data point per band. Error-bars are shown, which represent the standard deviation of the satellite and field data.<BR><BR>\n",

    "### Troubleshooting\n",
    "If the notebook does not complete, there are a few likely causes that can be checked.<BR>\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Cell [4] (Define 'alldata'...) errors:\n",
    "One of the most common is that the code will fail on Cell [4] (Define 'alldata'...), which is most likely because the input data files or directories are incorrectly formatted. Here are a list of errors and likely solutions:<BR>\n",
    "<B>ValueError: No objects to concatenate</B>: The code cannot find any relevant files. Check 'indir' is correct, check the line directories are formatted as line1, line2 etc. Also check .asd.rad.txt files in the line directories.<BR><BR>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<B>ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 6, got 0)</B>: Most likely there is one (or more) .asd.rad.txt file with incorrectly formatted header information. For example, a file that is not a spectrum at all.<BR><BR>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<B>ValueError: could not convert string to float: </B> with last error found at <B>31     return float(l[17:20])-float(l[20:27])/60</B>:<BR>One or more of the .asd.rad.txt files most likely has no GPS coordinates listed in the header. These are found on lines 23 and 24 of the .asd.rad.txt files.<BR><BR>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<B>ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10</B>: This is casued by an incorrectly formatted spectral file name, which is found on line 39 of the header. The code requires this line to be in the format \\*00.asd.rad or \\*00.asd, where the two numbers '00' will be read as the spectrum number. This error complains that it is finding a string at this position, rather than a number.<BR><BR>\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Datacube query errors:\n",
    "The notebook uses Datacube to extract satellite data for comparison. However, it is only expect that exactly one satellite dataset will be found. So errors can occur when no, or more than one dataset is found.<BR><BR>\n",
    "\n",
    "<B>Cell [27]: KeyError: 'the label [band11] is not in the [index]'</B>: This error occurs when you have previously generated a brdf_data array for Sentinel data but then process the workflow, assuming Landsat 8 data, with fewer bands. In this case, you need to re-calculate your BRDF array in Cell [4] for the correct satellite.<BR><BR>\n",
    "\n",
    "<B>Cell [30]: AttributeError: 'Dataset' object has no attribute 'x'</B>: This error is casued by Datacube not finding any relevant satellite data for the timerange given in Cell [2]. Check the dates given in timerange. Also check that Datacube contains the data that you are looking for. It is possible that the data have yet to be indexed, if the observations were recent.<BR><BR>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<B>Cell [37] AttributeError: Unknown property levels</B>. You will also see wierd histograms in this cell, where you expect to see colour images:<BR>\n",
    "This error is because Datacube found more than one observation for the selected timerange. This can happen if the timerange start and end dates are too far apart. It is also possible that this can happen if your field site is located in the overlapping region between two adjoining satellite observations. If it is the second case, you will need to enter a specific timerange (including hours/mins/seconds) that includes only the one observation you are interested in.<BR><BR>"
